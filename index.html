    <p>One of my first times ever camping was in Kananaskis Alberta. The camp ground was located at the bottom of a mountain called Mount Kidd. This was right beside a golf course and it had a mini recreation center as well! I had never experienced something like this before but it was a great way to end the summer! One night, me and my friends were playing spikeball in the field. The sun started to set and eneded up being one of the most beautiful sunsets of the summer. The sky turned all shades of orange and pink. I was able to get stunning pictures of it right at the foot of the mountain! It was an experience I would never forget. I would recommend this campsite to anyone looking for a nice place to get away! Not only does it have gorgeous views but also lots of space to set up games and activites! It it a pretty safe area, the only concern would be bears in which bear spray would be essential. Overall this camping experience was one that I will never forget and I would love to go back there one day!  </p>
